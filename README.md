# VBA-Projects
Small projects I have completed in VBA and Excel; they are described below:

1. VBAProject_NameCountry - Takes user inputs name and native country, and displays a message box welcoming the user.
2. VBAProject_ColumnSort - Alphabetically sorts the rows of different items, depending on the column the active cell is in.
3. VBAProject_DinosaurHeight - Takes user input of the name of a dinosaur, and finds its height through finding its data on the excel sheet.
4. VBAProject_DatingApplicaton - Takes user inputs name, date of birth, gender and what the user is looking for, and displays them on the excel sheet to be able to re-edit or re-register.
